# Harmony

Harmony is a simple metrics collection tool that reports CPU and memory consumption on Unix systems. Agents are installed on each
server participating and a collector API collects the metrics from each agent. Harmony's frontend is written in AngularIO using
TypeScript and the collector API and Agent are written in Python.
